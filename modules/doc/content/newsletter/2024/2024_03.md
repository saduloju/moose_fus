## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.02.28` Update

- Added capability to read and write sparse matrices in the
  ASCII/Matlab format used by PETSc. 
- Added capability to read mesh constraint rows from an arbitrary
  sparse matrix.  This will enable IGA solves on more flexible meshes
  without perfect body fit domains.
- Added vector-valued parameter support in Reduced-Basis code.
- Added normalization to Empirical Interpolation Method in
  Reduced-Basis code.
- Removed redundant mapping code for FEXYZ.  Instead use the common
  mapping code, which has additional optimizations, and which avoids a
  bug triggered by MOOSE use of those optimizations.
- Fixed bugs in Tet14 element refinement with non-default diagonal
  selection.
- Always number assembly element nodes contiguously when reading
  IsoGeometric Analysis meshes.  This avoids a bug in transient IGA
  solves on distributed meshes with discontinuous assembly elements.
- Minor bug fixes to example applications' common shell functions,
  test execution in configurations without numeric solver libraries,
  and an unused variable warning on newer compilers.
