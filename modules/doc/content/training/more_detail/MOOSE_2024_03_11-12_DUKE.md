The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) Solid Mechanics Workshop provides a
brief overview of the framework and an in-depth introduction to the MOOSE solid mechanics module
for solving solid mechanics problems. The course is 2 days in length and covers the mathematical
formulations, simulation setup, and development workflow for the solid mechanics module. The course
also demonstrates the integration of an external material modeling library, NEML2, into the
solid mechanics module to take advantage of GPUs. Hands-on exercises are supplied so attendees are
encouraged to bring their own hardware to participate.

Course Coordinator: Gary Hu (thu@anl.gov)

!alert note
This version of the training will only span two days.
