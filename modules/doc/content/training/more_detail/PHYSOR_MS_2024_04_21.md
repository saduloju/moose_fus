#### Course Description

!style! halign=left
The goal of the training session is to demonstrate the application of MOOSE-based tools for coupled
neutronics â€“ thermal-hydraulics modeling of liquid fuel molten salt reactors (MSRs). The training
session will be focused on developing a multiphysics model for a simplified model of the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE) by coupling neutronics based on the Griffin neutronics code, and thermal
hydraulics based on Pronghorn/SAM codes. Steady-state and a flow driven transient will be modeled
with demonstration of the delayed neutron precursor impacts.
